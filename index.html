					Travelling, photographing and cooking are what define me best. I launched my flickr blog <strong>He-art-</strong>, where I post my pictures so that everybody can see them. I'm quite active on social networks, so come and join me !

				<h2>Travelling üåç</h2>
				<p>
					Discover new cultures, meet new people, find new places to photograph, learn new languages... so many reasons to travel ! Travelling brought me a lot, it helped me flourish and grow. Actually, my biggest dream would be to go around the world.

				<h2>Photographing üì∑</h2>
				<p>
					My camera is with me wherever I go. I like to think that I can take a part of the place I saw with me, thanks to a photo. It's a way to remember and to preserve the memory of things that would have been forgotten long ago otherwise. Everything can be photographed, people, landscapes, houses, flowers... the world has so much beauty to show !

				<h2>Cooking üç±</h2>
				<p>
					One of the most difficult things when you start to live alone, is to find recipes that are easy, but also healthy. It's been one year now that I started living without my parents for studies, and I really like creating new dishes, trying new flavors, and eating good and healthy at the same time.
